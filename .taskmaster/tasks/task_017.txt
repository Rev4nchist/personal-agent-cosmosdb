# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Row-Level Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement row-level security in Cosmos DB to restrict data access based on user roles.
# Details:
1. Design security model for different entity types
2. Implement security filters in Gremlin queries
3. Develop a middleware for applying security filters
4. Integrate with Azure AD roles

Example row-level security implementation:
```javascript
function applySecurityFilter(query, userRole) {
    switch(userRole) {
        case 'Manager':
            return query.has('department', userDepartment);
        case 'HR':
            return query;
        default:
            return query.has('id', userId);
    }
}

async function executeSecureQuery(query, user) {
    const secureQuery = applySecurityFilter(query, user.role);
    return await client.submit(secureQuery);
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test data access for different user roles
2. Validate that users can't access unauthorized data
3. Measure performance impact of security filters
4. Test with large datasets to ensure scalability
