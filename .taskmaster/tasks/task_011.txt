# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Context-Aware Response Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to generate context-aware responses based on graph relationships and query results.
# Details:
1. Implement result interpretation logic
2. Develop natural language generation (NLG) system
3. Integrate with CosmosAIGraph for relationship context
4. Implement response templating system

Example context-aware response generation:
```python
from nltk.generate import NLGFactory

nlg = NLGFactory()

def generate_response(query_results, graph_context):
    interpreted_results = interpret_results(query_results)
    context_enriched = enrich_with_context(interpreted_results, graph_context)
    response_template = select_template(context_enriched)
    return nlg.generate(response_template, context_enriched)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test response accuracy for various query types
2. Validate context integration in responses
3. Measure response generation time
4. Conduct user acceptance testing for response quality
