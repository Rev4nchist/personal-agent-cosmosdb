             await page.goto(url)
             return page
     ```

4. Implement Enterprise Security Features
   - Azure AD Integration:
     ```python

         async def log_action(self, user, action, resource, result):
             # Create comprehensive audit log entry
             log_entry = {
                 "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                 "user": user,
                 "action": action,
                 "resource": resource,
                 "result": result,
                 "ip_address": self._get_client_ip()
             }
             await self.log_storage.store_log(log_entry)
     ```

5. Integration with Existing Systems
   - Connect to CosmosAIGraph for knowledge graph operations
   - Integrate with OmniRAG for information retrieval
   - Ensure compatibility with existing Azure AI Foundry services

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing
   - Test each custom skill individually
     ```python
     def test_graph_skill():
         # Mock cosmos client
         mock_client = MockCosmosClient()
         skill = GraphSkill(mock_client)
         
         # Test query functionality
         result = await skill.query_graph({"entity": "test_entity"})
         assert result is not None
         assert "nodes" in result
     ```
   
   - Test MCP adaptors with mock environments
     ```python
     def test_browserbase_adaptor():
         mock_config = {"api_key": "test_key"}
         adaptor = BrowserbaseAdaptor(mock_config)
         
         # Test initialization
         await adaptor.initialize()
         assert adaptor.session is not None
         
         # Test action execution
         result = await adaptor.execute_action({"type": "click", "selector": "#test"})
         assert result["status"] == "success"
     ```

2. Integration Testing
   - Test end-to-end agent workflows
     ```python
     def test_agent_workflow():
         agent = SunaAgent()
         agent.add_skill(GraphSkill(cosmos_client))
         agent.add_skill(DocumentSkill(ai_client))
         
         # Test complete workflow
         result = await agent.execute_task("find information about project X")
         assert result["status"] == "completed"
     ```
   
   - Test security integration
     ```python
     def test_security_integration():
         auth = AzureADAuth(tenant_id, client_id)
         rbac = RBACManager(auth)
         
         # Test authentication
         token = await auth.authenticate(test_credentials)
         assert token is not None
         
         # Test permission checking
         has_permission = await rbac.check_permission("test_user", "document_1", "read")
         assert has_permission is True
     ```

3. Security Testing
   - Perform penetration testing on agent endpoints
   - Verify proper token validation and expiration
   - Test audit logging for completeness
     ```python
     def test_audit_logging():
         logger = AuditLogger(mock_storage)
         
         # Test log creation
         await logger.log_action("user1", "read", "document_1", "success")
         
         # Verify log was stored
         logs = await mock_storage.get_logs(user="user1")
         assert len(logs) == 1
         assert logs[0]["action"] == "read"
     ```

4. Performance Testing
   - Measure response times for agent operations
   - Test under load to ensure stability
   - Verify resource usage remains within acceptable limits

5. Acceptance Testing
   - Verify all requirements are met
   - Conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders
   - Ensure compatibility with existing systems and workflows
