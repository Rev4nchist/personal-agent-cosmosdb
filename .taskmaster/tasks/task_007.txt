# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate Azure AI Foundry
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Azure AI Foundry for enhanced AI capabilities in the knowledge graph system.
# Details:
1. Set up Azure AI Foundry resources
2. Implement authentication and API integration
3. Develop wrapper functions for AI services
4. Integrate with knowledge graph queries

Example integration code:
```python
from azure.ai.foundry import AIFoundryClient

client = AIFoundryClient(endpoint, key)

async def enhance_query(query):
    enhanced_query = await client.enhance_query(query)
    return enhanced_query

async def process_results(results):
    enriched_results = await client.enrich_results(results)
    return enriched_results
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful API integration
2. Test AI enhancement on sample queries
3. Measure performance impact and optimize
4. Validate result enrichment accuracy
