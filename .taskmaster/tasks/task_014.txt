# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Cost Optimization Strategies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and implement strategies to optimize Azure costs while maintaining performance.
# Details:
1. Analyze RU consumption patterns
2. Implement time-based RU scaling
3. Optimize data models for cost-efficiency
4. Set up cost alerts and budgets

Example cost optimization code:
```python
from azure.mgmt.cosmosdb import CosmosDBManagementClient

def optimize_ru_provisioning(usage_pattern):
    recommended_ru = calculate_optimal_ru(usage_pattern)
    cosmos_client.database_accounts.update_throughput(
        resource_group_name,
        account_name,
        {'offerThroughput': recommended_ru}
    )
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Monitor cost savings after optimization
2. Test system performance under optimized settings
3. Validate auto-scaling effectiveness
4. Conduct cost projection analysis
