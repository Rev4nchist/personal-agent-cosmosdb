# Docker installation issues and alternatives (2025-06-02 18:28:41)

_**User**_

I just had a failed install of docker for this project @Dev Containers do I need this to run this project correctly - or is there another option

I can see you're dealing with a Dev Containers setup issue. Let me examine your project to understand whether Docker is actually required and what alternatives you have.

---

Read file: package.json

---

Could not find file '.devcontainer' in the workspace.

Read file: .devcontainer/devcontainer.json

## Good News: Docker is NOT Required! 

Based on my analysis of your project, **you can absolutely run this project without Docker**. Here's what I found:

### What This Project Is
This is an **Azure Cosmos DB TypeScript/Node.js quickstart application** that creates a web app with real-time features using Socket.IO.

### Why Docker Exists Here
The Docker setup (`.devcontainer/` and `Dockerfile`) is provided for **convenience and consistency**, not as a requirement. It's particularly useful for:
- GitHub Codespaces integration
- Ensuring consistent development environments across teams
- Pre-installing Azure CLI and other tools

### How to Run Without Docker

The README confirms you can run this locally with just Node.js:

1. **Install Node.js** (if you haven't already) - you need Node.js 18+ based on the devcontainer config
2. **Install dependencies and run**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Current Setup Requirements
Before running, you'll need to:
1. **Configure Azure Cosmos DB credentials** in `cosmos.ts`
2. **Have Node.js installed** (version 18 or higher recommended)

### Alternative Options if You Want Containerization Later
If you decide you want Docker benefits later (but it's not needed now):
- **GitHub Codespaces**: The project has a direct Codespaces link in the README
- **Local Docker**: Fix your Docker Desktop installation when convenient
- **WSL**: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux if you want Linux-based development

### Next Steps
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Configure your Azure Cosmos DB credentials in `cosmos.ts`
3. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`

Would you like me to help you set up the Azure Cosmos DB configuration or check if Node.js is properly installed on your system?
